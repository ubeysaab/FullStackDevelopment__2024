// Every partials should be imported to index file because is the one that's ultimately being compile and bringing every thing together 



// when we import partial file we don't have to add .scss extension the sass compiler is clever enough to figure that it self 

// ! The order of imports in file does matter
// 1. variables & functions : things gonna be usually over and over again
@import "./variables";
@import"./functions";

//2. base &layout stuff :  reset styles , top level styles  , grid system 
@import"./base";
@import "./breakpoints";
@import "./grid";

//3. colors : to generate classes like for backgrounds or text colors they're gonna use variables and maybe functions 
@import "./colors";

// 4. Components : (button, card ,navbar,etc..)
@import "./components/card";
@import"./components/buttons";

//5. Utilities : (margin,padding,border,opacity) classes
@import "./utilities"
// the order is showed above from 3to 5 might not matter so much  the main ones are 1 and 2
