# üìò Node.js HTTP Module Notes

```js
// http module is a core Node module
const { log } = require('console');
let httpModule = require('http');

// We can store an instance of the server in a variable just in case we want to use it in the future for something else like WebSocket.
const server = httpModule.createServer((request, response) => {
  // This callback function is gonna run every time a request comes in to our server.

  // Let's assume we request the home page (e.g., www.website.com). It sends a request to the server for the homepage,
  // then this function runs and sends the homepage.

  // Inside this function we get access to two different objects:
  // 1. The request object
  // 2. The response object

  //! The request object:
  // - Comes loaded with information about the request, such as the URL being requested.
  // - So if I go to mywebsite.com/about, I would be able to find that URL from the request object.
  // - It also includes other information like the request type (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).

  //! The response object:
  // - This is the object we use to send a response to the user in the browser.
  // - response.headers gives the browser more information about what kind of response is coming (also used to send cookies).

  console.log('Request made to this URL:', request.url);
  console.log("With these headers:", request.headers);

  // Set response header for content type
  response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');

  // Send data back to the browser
  response.write("<h1>Hello Endlessly Looping World</h1>");
  
  // Writing our body or head replaces the default one in the browser for us

  // End the response
  response.end();

  // üìù This is how easy it is to actually send a response, 
  // but you can already see that it's starting to look quite messy 
  // if we want to send more complex HTML.

  // üëâ So this really is a bad way to send HTML back.
  // Instead, we should create our HTML pages separately and then read these files using Node to send them to the client.
});

// To make our server live and listen for requests
server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () => {
  console.log('Listening for requests on port 3000');
});
```

Sure! Here's a well-organized list of **commonly used HTTP response status codes**, grouped by category, along with short descriptions. You can use these with `response.statusCode` or `response.writeHead()` in Node.js.

- üõ†Ô∏è Example in Node.js

```js
response.statusCode = 404;
response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
response.end('404 Not Found');
```

Would you like a helper function that sends common status messages automatically based on code?
