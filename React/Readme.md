# What is React any way ?
**Why do we care about React?**
What is React, and why should we use it? When should we use it?
- React is a JavaScript library, not a framework.

**Hah you are throwing new jargons at me  what the hell are library and frameworks**
*Library:* A set of tools you can use when you choose. You stay in control of the flow of your app.

*Framework:* Gives you a full structure and often tells you how to build your app, sometimes taking control away from you.

React is just a library. With mainly focuses on building the view layer of an application — nothing more, nothing less.

**React’s Core Idea: Components**
React using the approach of creating components (compenent is a piece of the user interface) so when we build an app with React *we build a bunch of independent isolated reusable componenets*. To build a UI, a React app must contain at least one component, which acts as the root of the application. This root component then holds other child components, effectively making every React app a tree of components.
