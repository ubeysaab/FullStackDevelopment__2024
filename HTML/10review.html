    Always Quote Attribute Values



    Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

            <!-- There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

            1.  Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
              Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

            Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it,
            you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

            2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here,
            the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page.
            Example: src="img_girl.jpg". 
            If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

            Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.
           Note: ## If we try to display an image that does not exist,
            the value of the 'alt'=alternateText attribute will be displayed instead. -->

    <!-- The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:-->
    <p style="color: aqua;" title="imUbey">How are you my friend </p>

<!-- HTML Display :  
        You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.

        Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.

        With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code. because the browser will ignore it
      Solution : The <pre> tag preserves both spaces and line breaks

<p>links in html 
  By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
<ul>
 <ol> An unvisited link is underlined and blue</ol>
 <ol>  A visited link is underlined and purple</ol>
 <ol> An active link is underlined and red</ol>
 Tip: Links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look!


</ul>

</p>
<h5 style="color: red;">By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.</h5>
<p>The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.</p>
<ul>
  <li>_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked</li>
  <li>_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
  </li>
  <li>_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
  </li>
  <li>_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
  </li>

</ul>

<p>Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
  Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.
  
  A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):</p>

<h3>HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
    <li>Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

      Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
      
      Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.</li>
