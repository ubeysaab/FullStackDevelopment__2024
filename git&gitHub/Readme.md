### finding the differences

dif take two directroy ar two files and show the differences between them in a few formates

when we call diff command we get only the lines they are different between two files .<remove from the first line ,> stand to added to the second file

- in this example 5c5,6 mean 5th line in the first file replaced by 5,6 in the second file (c mean change )

- 11a13-15 the differences is not obvious here so we can use diff -u

<!-- wdiff highlights words that changed inside the file
 , meld , Kdiff3  highlighted differences using colors  -->

### Generating diff files

diff -u oldFile new file > changes.diff
**_as a reminder the greater than sign redirects the output of the diff command to a file so with this command we generatig a file called change.diff with the contents of diff -u command_**

- by using -u flag we include more context which help the person reading the file understand what going on with the change
- the generated file usually referred as (diff or patch) file is includes all the changes between the old file and the new one plus the additional context needed to understand the changes and to apply those changes back to the original file

### applying changes

- but we don't need to apply these changes manually because there is a command called **patch** to do exactly this patch takes a file generated by diff and applies the changes to the original file.

now we have the diff file and we want to apply it to our script so we use patch command

 <!-- we use less than sympol to redirect the contents fo the file to standart input -->

```bash
patch nameOfTheFileWeWannaPatchIn  <  changes.diff
```

---

we have seen up till now how we can use existing tools to extract differences between versions of files. and apply those changes back to the original files. Those tools are very useful but most of the time , we won't be using them directly instead , we'll use them through a
**_Version Control System (VCS)_** : which keeps track of the changes that we make to our files(keeps track of all the different versions that we create as we save our changes), by using VCS we can know when the changes were made and who made them . it also lets us easily revert a change, and makes collaboration easier by allowing us to merge changes from lots of different sources.
